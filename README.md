Eg. 
- Using the place order input you can play around the by changing the name of taco less than 5 characters and see the response below.

    "message": "Taco name is required at least 5 characters",
    "path": "/api/order/placeOrder"
}
 
- Also you remove all ingredient on a specific taco input so the ingredients have empty array or []. Please see the response below.

    "status": 500,
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
